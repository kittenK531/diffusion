pip --user install matplotlib.pyplot 
```

## Compilation
Use the following command to run
```
python3 main.py
```
## Input 
The code is written as OOP, where allow the users to input variables under the class ```Laplace```

* ```gridsize```: Size of Grid
* ```h```: The distance of grid site to the neighbour
* ```rho_epsilon```: The charge per epsilon
* ```iteration```: The iteration times

## Output
There are two images output from the programme
